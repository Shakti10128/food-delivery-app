Yes, Shakti — in a microservice project, apart from DTOs, Enums, Custom Exceptions, ErrorResponse, and JWT utils, there are a few other things that are usually kept in a common-lib so multiple microservices can reuse them. Here’s a structured list for your food delivery microservice:

1️⃣ DTOs

UserDto → shared across Auth, Order, and Restaurant services.

LoginResponseDto → AuthService → other services may need it.

OrderDto → basic info for orders that other services (like DeliveryService) may need.

MenuItemDto → Restaurant menu items shared with OrderService.

2️⃣ Enums

Role → CUSTOMER, RESTAURANT, DELIVERY_AGENT, ADMIN.

OrderStatus → PLACED, CONFIRMED, PREPARING, READY_FOR_PICKUP, PICKED_UP, DELIVERED, CANCELLED.

PaymentStatus (optional) → PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED, REFUNDED.

3️⃣ Exception Handling

CustomException and all specific exceptions.

ErrorResponse and optional ErrorResponseBuilder.

4️⃣ JWT Utils

Token generation, validation, claim extraction.

5️⃣ Constants / Configs

ApiConstants → e.g., default page size, max retry count, default roles.

Messages → shared error or success messages.

public class ApiConstants {
    public static final int DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE = 20;
    public static final int MAX_RETRY = 3;
}

public class Messages {
    public static final String USER_NOT_FOUND = "User not found";
    public static final String ORDER_NOT_FOUND = "Order not found";
}

6️⃣ Mappers / Converters (Optional)

Convert Entity ↔ DTO in a reusable way using MapStruct or manual converters.

Example: UserMapper, OrderMapper.

7️⃣ Validation Utilities (Optional)

Common validation logic for email format, phone number, password rules.

✅ Recommendation for Your Learning Microservice

For now, essential items to keep common:

DTOs: UserDto, OrderDto, LoginResponseDto.

Enums: Role, OrderStatus.

Exceptions + ErrorResponse + ErrorResponseBuilder.

JWT Utils.

Optional: ApiConstants + Messages.

Leave mappers or validators optional for later, once your microservices grow.
